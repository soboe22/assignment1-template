# 🧮 Smart Utility Calculator

## 🎯 Objective
Practice using branching statements (`if`, `if-else`, `else-if`, `switch`) to solve real-world problems through multiple decisions.

---

## 📝 Problem Statement
Write a Java program that performs different utility calculations based on a user's choice.  
The program should display the following menu:


### Program Requirements

1. **Use a `switch` statement** to handle the user’s menu selection.  
2. Inside each case, **use `if-else` statements** to make decisions as needed.  
3. **Handle invalid menu choices** gracefully.

---

## 💡 Case Details

### **Case 1: Even or Odd**
- Declare and initialize an integer `n`.
- Print `"Even"` if divisible by 2, otherwise print `"Odd"`.

### **Case 2: Largest of Three Numbers**
- Declare and initialize three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
- Use **nested if-else** statements to find and print the largest number.

### **Case 3: Grade Calculator**
- Declare and initialize a score (`0–100`).
- Use an **else-if ladder**:


### **Case 4: Simple Calculator**
- Declare and initialize two numbers and an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
- Use a **nested switch** inside this case to perform the operation.
- Print the result.
- Handle **division by zero** properly.

### **Case 5: Exit**
- Print `"Goodbye!"` and stop the program.

### **Invalid Choice**
- Display `"Invalid menu option."`

## 🧾 Grading Criteria (Total: 100 points)

| Category | Description | Points |
|-----------|--------------|--------|
| **1. Program Structure** | Correct `class` and `main()` definition, proper syntax, indentation, and comments describing purpose. | 10 pts |
| **2. Menu Logic (switch-case)** | Correctly implements main switch with all 5 cases and default. Each case executes properly. | 15 pts |
| **3. Case 1 – Even/Odd Check** | Correct use of `if-else` to determine parity; accurate output formatting. | 10 pts |
| **4. Case 2 – Largest of Three Numbers** | Proper use of nested `if-else` or chained conditions to find and print the largest value. | 15 pts |
| **5. Case 3 – Grade Calculator** | Correct `else-if` ladder, valid range checking (0–100), accurate letter grade output. | 15 pts |
| **6. Case 4 – Simple Calculator** | Correct internal switch for operators (+, -, *, /). Includes division-by-zero check and valid results. | 15 pts |
| **7. Case 5 – Exit / Default Handling** | Prints `"Goodbye!"` for 5 and `"Invalid option"` for any other number. | 5 pts |
| **8. Output Clarity & Testing** | Sample test values provided; outputs clearly labeled and easy to interpret. | 10 pts |
| **9. Code Readability & Comments** | Consistent indentation, spacing, and at least one explanatory comment per case. | 5 pts |
